		1)Hierarchy
			a) Issue with hierarchy ordering. How to implement OrderHierarchyBy, ThenHierarchyBy correctly?
			How OrderBy and ThenBy implemented in LINQ? (My implementation of OrderHierarchyBy in CodoSchool.EntityBase.Linq.Extensions -> EntityExtensionsProvider). What is IOrderedEnumerable???
			b) Eager loading in EFCore ( as lazy loading is not yet implemented ). <question about depth of loading child objects - only immediate children or full hierarchy>?
